I'm Taylor, an aspiring electrical engineer and hobbyist programmer. This is my personal website and on it you can find some information about me, my career, hobbies, interests, and side projects. Additionally, the site includes a blog where I hope to document some of the fun experiences I am fortunate enough to have. But first, check out what I'm up to on social media (hint: not much):

## Programming

I have been programming in my spare time for the better part of a decade now. It's only for fun (for now), and I can't say I've done anything too profound with my skills, but I enjoy getting lost in an interesting programming problem for hours at a time. Click the button below to see some of my completed coursework and projects.

## Blog

Finally, check out my [blog](/blog/). I don't anticipate I'll update it terribly often, but if the point of this site is to showcase my skills, interests, and achievements, then I hope the point of the blog will be to talk about the processes and tools I use to hone my skills, engage my interests, and accomplish my achievements.
